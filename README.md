# My-School-Projects

To all whom these presents, Greetings,

It is likely that you are reading this as a result of receiving my resume or card, or otherwise have been sent here pursuant to my interest in finding a career with you or the firm you represent.
This is a Repository of my past programming course work or side projects which demonstrate generally my craftsmanship in this field.

About me:
I am a former Navy Nuke Electrician's Mate (Submarines) - this is one of, if not the most acidemically rigorous training program the US military has to offer, with a high drop-out rate even among the brightest individuals in the Navy; to have been a Nuke is a difficult endeavor which I am proud to have acheived, and I mention it here because it is indeed an acheivement which speaks for itself to those acquainted with what it means.
I attended college briefly as a dual-enrolled high school student and learned HTML/CSS many years ago, as well as basic fundamentals of computer programming before joining the Navy as a Nuke.
Afterwards, I became a calibration technician for Yokogawa Corporation of America, who manufactures precision electronic measurementation instruments; where I used calibration software and manual procedures to calibrate and adjust those instruments.
While doing this job, I endeavored to teach myself to code (more/ again) using the same environment the company used for the calibration software, Microsoft Visual Basics for Applications running in Excel workbooks, to automate some of the tasks that were still manual for calibrating several machines.
doing this taught me MS VBA and got me well acquainted with functional programming, as well as with HP's GPIB (General Purpose Interface Bus) library to talk to the machines involved.
after covid, I got a job doing industrial maintenance, and decided to go to college to pursue IT and programming in general, as I have thoroughly enjoyed what programming I got to do in the past, even without much formal training in the field.
in college, I took classes covering networking, C#, Java, databases and SQL, digital PLDs like FPGA's et al, project management, and more; and have so far acheived an AS in Computer Information Technology with honors, and hope to get a BS in IT while working in this industry if I can find a job doing so.

In this Repository:
unfortunately, I did not save any of my work from before college using MS VBA and GPIB, so those acheivements will be absent from this repo; but I do have, and will post here, various tools I have made in my free time using the similar Libre Office Basic on Libre Office Calc sheets. These tools are largely for Dungeons and Dragons, a hobby I partake in, but I'm including them here because they none the less do contain examples of my experience coding to solve various problems.
separated by course and in folders for each project, I will over time comb through the files to add readmes for the individual projects if I can remember what the guidance for each item was, but for now, I will upload the projects themselves with no such explanations to get them out.
